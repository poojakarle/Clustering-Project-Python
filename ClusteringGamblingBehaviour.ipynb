A preliminary look at the Bustabit data\n<p>The similarities and differences in the behaviors of different people have long been of interest, particularly in psychology and other social science fields. Understanding human behavior in particular contexts can help us to make informed decisions. Consider a game of poker - understanding why players raise, call, and fold in various situations can provide a distinct advantage competitively.</p>\n<p>Along these lines, we are going to focus on the behavior on <strong>online gamblers</strong> from a platform called <a href=\"https://www.bustabit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bustabit</a>. There are a few basic rules for playing a game of Bustabit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You bet a certain amount of money (in Bits, which is 1 / 1,000,000th of a Bitcoin) and you win if you cash out before the game <strong>busts</strong>.</li>\n<li>Your win is calculated by the multiplier value at the moment you cashed out. For example, if you bet 100 and the value was 2.50x at the time you cashed out, you win 250. In addition, a percentage <code>Bonus</code> per game is multiplied with your bet and summed to give your final <code>Profit</code> in a winning game. Assuming a <code>Bonus</code> of 1%, your <code>Profit</code> for this round would be <code>(100 x 2.5) + (100 x .01) - 100 = 151</code></li>\n<li>The multiplier increases as time goes on, but if you wait too long to cash out, you may bust and lose your money.</li>\n<li>Lastly, the house maintains slight advantages because in 1 out of every 100 games, everyone playing busts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Below we see an example of a winning game:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_643/img/bustabit_win.gif\" alt></p>\n<p>And a losing game, for comparison:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_643/img/bustabit_loss.gif\" alt></p>\n<p>Our goal will be to define relevant <strong>groups</strong> or <strong>clusters</strong> of Bustabit users to identify what patterns and behaviors of gambling persist. Can we describe a particular group as risk-averse? Is there a set of gamblers that have a strategy that seems to be more successful in the long term?</p>\n<p>The data you will be working with includes over 40000 games of Bustabit by a bit over 4000 different players, for a total of 50000 rows (one game played by one player).

Visualize the clusters with a Parallel Coordinate Plot\n<p>We can already learn a bit about our cluster groupings by looking at the previous table.

We can visualize these group differences graphically using a Parallel Coordinate Plot or PCP.

However, min-max scaling has the advantage of <strong>interpretability</strong> - a value of 1 for a particular variable indicates that cluster has the highest value compared to all other clusters, and a value of 0 indicates that it has the lowest. This can help make relative comparisons between the clusters more clear.</p>\n<p>The <code>ggparcoord()</code> function from <code>GGally</code> will be used to produce a Parallel Coordinate Plot.

They seem to maintain a strategy (or an automated script/bot) that works to earn them money.</p>\n<p><strong><p style=\"color:#7570b3\">Risky Commoners:</p></strong> These users seem to be a step above the Cautious Commoners in their Bustabit gambling habits, making larger average bets, and playing a larger number of games on the site. As a result, though they have about the same number of average games won as the Risk Takers, they have a significantly higher number of games lost.</p>\n<p><strong><p style=\"color:#1b9e77\">Risk Takers: </p></strong> These users have played only a couple games on average, but their average cashed out value is significantly higher than the other clusters, indicating that they tend to wait for the multiplier to increase to large values before cashing out.</p>\n<p><strong><p style=\"color:#e7298a\">High Rollers:</p></strong> High bets are the name of the game for this group.
